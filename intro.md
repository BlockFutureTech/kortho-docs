# KorTho-the base chain for data rights


## Introduction to KTO Open Platform
Kortho Open Platform is an infrastructure that is fully open to the blockchain industry one after another based on the technical resources, traffic resources and ecological resources of Kortho Lab. The goal is to make decentralized applications more efficient and less costly to build. Kortho Open Platform will provide more diversified basic services and innovative services for global developers.

## Introduction to KorTho basic chain of KTO
 Kortho Chain is committed to building a decentralized public chain for data rights, which is equal, mutual trust, inclusive and efficient. Kortho Chain consists of P2P network, ED25519 signature algorithm, secp256k1 elliptic curve algorithm, SHA-3 encryption algorithm and BADGER persistent K-V storage database and other cryptographic technologies.

The technology of Kortho Chain enables global users to easily participate in data right for corroboration and bookkeeping through the PPOS (POW ➕ POS) consensus algorithm mechanism, so that they can gain the benefits of data bookkeeping.

The specific smart contracts of Kortho Chain will interact with the smart contracts of Ether EVM and various public chains to achieve cross-chain technology, thus bringing users a more efficient, friendly and smooth interaction experience. At the same time, global technology developers can develop various applications such as KRC-20 tokens, NFT, DeFi, games and metaverse in Kortho Chain.

## Declaration
Help developers at every stage of their growth. 

## Vision
Create the center of global blockchain's data hub. Realize the super cross-chain system of interconnection of all chains.

## Performance
- TPS：5000+
- Average block interval: 10s

## Consensus Mechanism
PPOS (POW➕POS) consensus mechanism.sm.

## Economic Model 
- The data can produce 1 block in 10 seconds and 1 block can incentivize the output of 1.6778 KTO. Each year output block will be will be reduced by 10% of the KTO incentive.
- Data node pledge KTO reduces the difficulty of calculation and improves the probability of block production. The pledge period of data node is 120 days, and the linear release period is 120 days.
- The KTO rewarded at the data node out of the block will be released 30% on the same day, and the remaining 70% will be released linearly by 120 days.


## Technical Characteristics
- Open and decentralized networks to maintain network and asset security;
- Support proof protocol, optimize peer-to-peer transaction function.
- Support EVM programmability, smart contract compatibility, reduce development or migration costs;


## Current Stage
In October 2021, KorTho Chain will officially launch the "public test" phase of PPOS (PoW ➕ POS), which will focus on improving the on-chain infrastructure, including but not limited to: prophecy machines, voting tools, anchor coins, DEX, lending, finance, insurance, synthetic assets, cross-chain solutions, data analytics, smart contract innovation, etc.

## Support Planning
### Support planning for funds
- KorTho will set up a special fund to invest, support and encourage quality developers
- KorTho will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to identify and fund potential developers around the world
- In order to reduce the participation costs of large users on KorTho Dapp, KorTho on-chain transactions will minimize the transaction fees of KTO holders

### Support planning for flow
Kortho Lab will strongly support the development of KorTho Chain
- Provide in-station traffic entry for premium DApps on KorTho

### Support planning for resource
- Funded projects or developers can not only get official coverage, but also apply to official marketing service packages and promote their projects worldwide
- Quality projects can participate in KorTho global roadshow activities free of charge
- KTO Lab will open technological ecological resources and match high-quality developers with ecological partners for win-win cooperation

## Risk Warning
- All users and developers can participate in KorTho's test environment and subsequent phases for free. There is no charge.
- Be sure to distinguish between the test environment and the main network environment. The assets generated by the test environment do not have any value. Beware of fake currency scams.
- KorTho will announce authorization, referrals and other cooperation through official social media platforms. Developers and users should check carefully to avoid losses.
- Be sure to check the official website (https://www.kortho.org/) to avoid phishing your private keys.
